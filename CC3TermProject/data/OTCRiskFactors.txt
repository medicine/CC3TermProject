 x                                            Illegal drug risk factors are various factors that contribute to an increased likelihood
 x                                            of individuals engaging in drug abuse or becoming involved in the illegal drug trade.

 x                                            These risk factors can be categorized into several domains, including individual, social,
 x                                            and environmental factors. Understanding these risk factors is crucial for developing
 x                                            effective prevention and intervention strategies to address the problem of illegal drug use.

 x                                            It's important to note that these risk factors do not guarantee that an individual will
 x                                            engage in illegal drug use, but they indicate a higher susceptibility.

 x                                            Prevention efforts should focus on addressing these risk factors by promoting positive
 x                                            coping mechanisms, providing education and support, and fostering healthy environments
 x                                            that discourage drug use. Additionally, early intervention and treatment for individuals
 x                                            already involved in drug abuse can help mitigate the negative consequences and further harm.
