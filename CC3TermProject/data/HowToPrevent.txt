 x                                            Prescription drug abuse may occur in people who need painkillers, sedatives or stimulants to treat a medical condition.
 x                                            If you're taking a prescription drug that commonly leads to drug misuse, here are ways to reduce your risk:

 x                                            Make sure you're getting the right medicine. Make sure your health care provider clearly understands
 x                                            your condition and the signs and symptoms. Tell your health care provider about all your prescriptions,
 x                                            as well as over-the-counter medicines, herbs and supplements, and alcohol and other drug use.
 x                                            Ask your doctor whether there's another medicine with ingredients that have less potential for addiction.

 x                                            Check in with your health care provider. Talk with your health care provider on a regular basis to make sure that the medicine
 x                                            is working and you're taking the right dose.

 x                                            Follow directions carefully. Use your medicine the way it was prescribed. Don't stop or change the dose of a drug on your own
 x                                            if it doesn't seem to be working without talking to your health care provider.
 x                                            For example, if you're taking a pain medicine that isn't adequately controlling your pain, don't take more.

 x                                            Know what your medicine does. Ask your health care provider or pharmacist about the effects of your medicine,
 x                                            so you know what to expect. Also check if other drugs, over-the-counter products or alcohol should be avoided when taking this medicine.
 x                                            Never use another person's prescription. Everyone is different. Even if you have a similar medical condition,
 x                                            it may not be the right medicine or dose for you. Don't order prescriptions online unless they're from a trustworthy pharmacy.
 x                                            Some websites sell counterfeit prescription and over-the-counter drugs that could be dangerous.
