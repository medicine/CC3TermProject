 x                                            A: Each drug of abuse is unique and will act on the brain in a different way.
 x                                            However, all drugs share a something in common - a chemical called dopamine. When a person uses a drug,
 x                                            their brain releases dopamine to produce the feeling of being "high." But when a person uses drugs repeatedly,
 x                                            their brain adjusts to the surges of dopamine that occur. In time, their bodies get used to this chemical and demand more of it.

 x                                            such as good food or friendships. The user also begins to lose the ability to resist these bad cravings,
 x                                            making it harder for him or her to quit.
